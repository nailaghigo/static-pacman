# Challenge 1: Static Pacman Web

## Objective
Achieve the ability for Pacman to eat the "Power Cookie" without touching the ghost.

## Functionalities
1. Upon pressing an arrow key on the keyboard, Pacman should move 3 pixels in the direction of the arrow.

3. When Pacman touches the red ghost, an alert message should be displayed, indicating that the game has been lost.

## Considerations
1. The code must be implemented using 100% HTML5, CSS3, and ES5.
2. The code should be neat and consistent.
3. The project must be uploaded to a public repository on Github and should be playable using Github Pages.
4. Making commits with meaningful messages is a plus.
5. The maximum time allowed to solve the challenge is 2 hours.
